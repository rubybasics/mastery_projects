# Job Basket

Let's build an application that helps us find and sort student jobs.

## Premise & Goal

It's hard to find jobs. Let's build an application that can scrape job listings
from many sources. Then, as a job seeker, offer you tools to categorize listings
you're interested in, ignore ones you're not, and maybe even suggest ones that
you should check out.

## Materials

There are no existing projects or wireframes to build upon.

## Technical Expectations

This is an important project that will hopefully live on for years. You should
focus on building small components that do one job. We'll start with the basics
(Ruby, Rails, jQuery, and PostgreSQL), but along the way there may be space
for stepping outside the box. The application needs to emphasize smart scalability
and should be broken out into a collection of services.
