# Opportunity@Work / TechHire

In this project you're building a production-ready application for our friends
at Opportunity@Work.

## Premise

The application is the first step in the actualization of the White House /
Opportunity@Work initiative TechHire. We're taking in designs created
for the organization and bringing them to life.

Jeff will act as the liason to Opportunity@Work where Tyra is the primary
point of contact. Dave from Google is working on the design. Roy (external) 
will likely do the slicing into HTML & CSS. Jeff will be your customer, Horace will
be your technical adivisor.

## Goal

The application's primary responsibility is to allow companies to register
as wanting to participate in TechHire. That part should be relatively easy.

From there we'll implement a CMS to run the content of the site and allow
for easy editing.

Beyond those features we'll get feedback from the O@W team for the next steps.

## Materials

You can find Adobe Illustrator files here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/eulhlwadg0z1cfb/Final-AI-Files.zip?dl=0

Updates are expected early the week of 4/20.

## Technical Expectations

This project needs to stay easy for others to pickup if Turing is not able to work on it. Tech
choices need to be simple: Ruby, Rails, jQuery, and PostgreSQL. If you feel a need for more
we'll discuss it.
